# REFBOOK
Have trouble remembering something you wanted to visit later on the web? Use REFBOOK!

## Why I Created This?
I am a college student and with my college studies, I am specializing in Web Development in React.js. I have to remember many topics to learn and where to find resources for them on the web. I often have to surf the web all over again because I cannot juggle this information and looking for something in history is very frustrating. That's why I created REFBOOK; it stores this information for me. 

## Usage
### 1. When I need to go to a topic, I can:
    1. Search the reference for it using the searchbar at the very top and / or find the reference.
    2. Click on 'Go to Ref' button

### 2. When I need to create a reference, I can:
    1. Click on the 'Add a reference' button.
    2. Enter the details in the form.
    3. Click on 'Save' button to add, or 'Cancel' to cancel.

### 3. When I want to edit a reference, I can:
    1. Search for it using the searchbar at the top and / or find it.
    2. Click on 'Edit' button on the bottom right of the reference card.
    3. Enter the details in the form.
    4. Click on 'Save' button to save changes, or 'Cancel' to cancel edit.

### 4. When I want to delete a reference, I can:
    1. Search for it using the searchbar at the top and / or find it.
    2. Click on 'Delete' button on the bottom right of the reference card.
    3. Click on 'Yes' button to delete, or 'No' to cancel.
